/**
 * An encapsulation of the evaluation of the body of an action so it is
 * available to a tag handler. BodyContent is a subclass of JspWriter.
 * <p>
 * Note that the content of BodyContent is the result of evaluation, so it will
 * not contain actions and the like, but the result of their invocation.
 * <p>
 * BodyContent has methods to convert its contents into a String, to read its
 * contents, and to clear the contents.
 * <p>
 * The buffer size of a BodyContent object is unbounded. A BodyContent object
 * cannot be in autoFlush mode. It is not possible to invoke flush on a
 * BodyContent object, as there is no backing stream.
 * <p>
 * Instances of BodyContent are created by invoking the pushBody and popBody
 * methods of the PageContext class. A BodyContent is enclosed within another
 * JspWriter (maybe another BodyContent object) following the structure of their
 * associated actions.
 * <p>
 * A BodyContent is made available to a BodyTag through a setBodyContent() call.
 * The tag handler can use the object until after the call to doEndTag().
